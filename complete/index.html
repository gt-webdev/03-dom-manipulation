  <!--- Oh, Hi. You just stumbled on this super high quality piece of code.
  Perhaps you've seen it featured on the History Channel's Modern Marvels
  because, you know, it's such a modern marvel. -->

  <!-- Anyay, this is the HTML file. Id doesn't contain much becuse we generate
  most of the things in this program using JavaScript via the jQuery library -->
  <head>
    <!-- This include the jQuery ui CSS stylesheet. I'll explain jQuery UI in a
    few lines -->
    <link data-require="jqueryui@1.10.0" data-semver="1.10.0" rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.0/css/smoothness/jquery-ui-1.10.0.custom.min.css" />

    <!-- You can include jQuery by simply requesting it from Google. Keep in
    mind that jQuery is just a library, and Google is just one of many hosts
    that you can download it from. You could also download jQuery and host it
    from your own server -->
    <script data-require="jquery@*" data-semver="2.2.0" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <!-- This includes jQuery UI. Base jQuery doesn't do everything you might
    want (in this case I've included jQuery UI because you can't animate
    background colours without it), so you can download addon libraries. -->
    <script data-require="jqueryui@1.10.0" data-semver="1.10.0" src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.0/jquery-ui.js"></script>

    <!-- The following two lines allow us to include our two custom files
    which you can look at by selecting them on the menu to the left -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <script src="script.js"></script>

    <!-- This is the main area where all of our stuff happens. Notice that it
    doesn't contain much. Just the mouse pointer and an area for the health
    bar to go -->
